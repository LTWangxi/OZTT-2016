If something happens which is beyond our reasonable control which makes it impossible, more difficult or more expensive for us to perform our obligations in our usual way then we may wait until it is again possible for us to perform our obligations in our usual way without additional difficulty or expense and we are not liable for any delay which results. If delay or failure to deliver is caused by force majeure or labour dispute we may suspend delivery, supply or completion and/or terminate the contract. Force Majeure means an act of God, war, lightning, fire, earthquake, storm, flood explosion, unavailability or delay in availability of equipment materials or transport, and any other cause whether of the kind specifically enumerated or otherwise which is not within our control. Whilst we shall use reasonable endeavours to comply with your particular delivery requirements and order specifications, you will not be entitled to cancel the whole or part of an order or to claim compensation by reason of our failure to comply with your delivery requirements or minor variations to the goods as a result of changes to the manufacturing processes or specifications. Delivery times are estimates only and we are not liable for delays in delivery. In this respect you agree that time is not of the essence. We may deliver in any number of instalments.

Delivery Details
			</span>
		</div>
		</br>
		<div>
			<span>
We deliver Australia wide but not internationally.
			</span>
		</div>
		</br>
		<div>
			<span>
Every order is dispatched via our own delivery system and we aim to get every order to you as quickly as possible. Sometimes we find your items from our stores to ensure our best sellers are always available, this may mean your order takes slightly longer to get to you.
			</span>
		</div>
		</br>
		<div>
			<span>
We encourage 1 business day handling and 2-5 business days delivery time. However, they will likely arrive in 2-5 business days. We'll always do our best to get it to you as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, we cannot deliver on a public holiday.
			</span>
		</div>
		</br>
		<div>
			<span>
Once your product is packed and dispatched (this will happen on the same business day we get your order if your order is prior to 2pm), we will contact you.
			</span>
		</div>
		</br>
		<div>
			<span>
If you are not around to take delivery of your parcel, it will either be left in a safe location or you will be left a calling card telling you how you can pick up your parcel.
